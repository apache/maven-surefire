      <p>${project.name} ${project.version} is distributed in source format. Use a source archive if you intend to build
      ${project.name} yourself. Otherwise, simply use the ready-made binary artifacts from central repository.</p>

      <p>You will be prompted for a mirror - if the file is not found on yours, please be patient, as it may take 24
      hours to reach all mirrors.<p/>

      <p>In order to guard against corrupted downloads/installations, it is highly recommended to
      <a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/release-signing#verifying-signature">verify the signature</a>
      of the release bundles against the public <a href="https://www.apache.org/dist/maven/KEYS">KEYS</a> used by the Apache Maven
      developers.</p>

      <p>${project.name} is distributed under the <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/">Apache License, version 2.0</a>.</p>

      <p></p>We <b>strongly</b> encourage our users to configure a Maven repository mirror closer to their location, please read <a href="./guides/mini/guide-mirror-settings.html">How to Use Mirrors for Repositories</a>.</p>
