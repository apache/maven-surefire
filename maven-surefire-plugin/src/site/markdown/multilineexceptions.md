Multi-line exception messages
=============================

Surefire 2.19 introduced special handling for multi-lined exception messages in order to faciliate vertical alignment. For example,

    java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: My Couch
       |
       May not contain whitespace
    
becomes:

      java.lang.IllegalArgumentException:
      The Couch
         |
         May not contain whitespace

The plugin supports Groovy assertion output.
For more information see the issue https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SUREFIRE-986.
