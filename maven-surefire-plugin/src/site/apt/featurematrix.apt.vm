    Legend: Y means supported, N means not supported. ? means not tested.

    If you would like to implement support for
    a given provider with an N or a ? (or create tests for it), you should create a patch and mark the issue is an
    improvement. If there is something wrong with an implementation marked with "Y" it's a bug.
