Feature Matrix

    Not all features are supported for all test frameworks, and the following table gives a brief overview
    of support status:

    Legend: "Y" means supported, "N" means not supported. "?" means not tested.

    If you would like to implement support for
    a given provider with an "N" or a "?" (or create tests for it), you should create a patch and mark the issue as an
    improvement. If there is something wrong with an implementation marked with "Y" that is considered a bug.
