When working with surefire, it is necessary to understand a few things:

JDK Versions
  The surefire booter is capable of booting all the way back to jdk1.3. Specifically
  this means surefire-api, surefire-booter, common-junit3 and surefire-junit3 are
  source/target 1.3. The plugin itself is 1.4 and several providers are 1.5.

Provider Isolation
  Classes in the SUT (Subject Under Test), override any classes within the
  surefire providers. This means providers using any
  third party dependencies (other than the test framework itself), should
  shade these classes to a different package.

Common provider modules
  The surefire-providers module contains common-junitXX modules. These modules
  depend on the XX version of JUnit and can access the JUnit API's at the correct
  JUnit version level. Unit tests can also be written that will run with the
  correct JUnit version. At build time, all of the relevant parts of these "common"
  modules are just shaded into the providers jar files.

Shadefire
  "Shadefire" is the first module to be run in the
  surefire build. This creates as shaded version of the JUnit provider, and this provider
  is thereafter used to build surefire itself (As of any release after 2.8). This is
  because the SUT overrides the provider, and the shadefire provider has been
  relocated to avoid this overriding when surefire is building itself.

Deploying/releasing surefire
  Surefire depends on a previous version of itself, which
  is too advanced for maven 2.2.x dependency resolution, and maven 3.x is
  required to build surefire. Until a 3.x site plugin is released the site
  for surefire has to be deployed with mvn 2.2.1 (using -N option).
