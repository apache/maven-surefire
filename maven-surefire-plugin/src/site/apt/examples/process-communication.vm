Communication Channels used between the Maven Process and Surefire Process

  There is one way to change the communication channel and two types of connection in the ${thisPlugin}.
  The communication channel can be changed even by the user in the user's POM.
  The physical layer of the channel can be switched from Process Pipes to TCP/IP.
  The user select the default implementations in the POM or the user can implement his own channel without asking
  the Apache Maven development team for a new support. This chapter will show you how this can be accomplished.

* forkNode

  The configuration is done by using only one configuration parameter <<<forkMode>>>.

* The TCP/IP communication channel

  The ${thisPlugin} plugin uses process pipes by default. The implementation class for default configuration
  is <<<org.apache.maven.plugin.surefire.extensions.LegacyForkNodeFactory>>> and it does not have to be specified.
  The TCP/IP channel can be selected as follows and the implementation class has to be specified:

+---+
<project>
    [...]
    <build>
        <plugins>
            [...]
            <plugin>
                <groupId>${project.groupId}</groupId>
                <artifactId>${project.artifactId}</artifactId>
                <version>${project.version}</version>
                <configuration>
                    <forkNode implementation="org.apache.maven.plugin.surefire.extensions.SurefireForkNodeFactory"/>
                </configuration>
            </plugin>
            [...]
        </plugins>
    </build>
    [...]
</project>
+---+

* Custom implementation

  The custom implementation involves two implementations. The first is used by the Maven process and there you
  should implement the interface <<<org.apache.maven.surefire.extensions.ForkNodeFactory>>>, use the implementation
  in a dependency <<<your-extension-api-impl-artifactid>>> declared below the plugin and configuration should
  specify fully qualified class name of your custom <<<ForkNodeFactory>>> in the attribute <<<implementation>>>.

  The second implementation is SPI which is utilized by the forked JVM. Implement the Java SPI interface
  <<<org.apache.maven.surefire.spi.MasterProcessChannelProcessorFactory>>> in the artifact
  <<<your-extension-spi-impl-artifactid>>>.

  Your SPI implementation appears in
  <<<src/main/resources/META-INF/services/org.apache.maven.surefire.spi.MasterProcessChannelProcessorFactory>>>
  and contains one implementation class. Your POM already specified it, see
  <<<your.extention.api.impl.CustomForkNodeFactory>>>.
