Using Console Logs

* Suppressed logs

  Since version 2.19 few lines are suppressed by surefire and failsafe plugin in std/out, namely

  * report directory,

  * Java class of provider,

  * configuration of parallel execution and

  * Java class of TestNG configurator.

  []

  In order to enable detailed logs, use any of CLI Maven option, i.e. -X,--debug,-e,--errors.
  The result would be e.g.:


+---+
[INFO] Surefire report directory: /path/to/project/target/surefire-reports
[INFO] Using configured provider org.apache.maven.surefire.junitcore.JUnitCoreProvider
[INFO] parallel='none', perCoreThreadCount=true, threadCount=0, useUnlimitedThreads=false, threadCountSuites=0, threadCountClasses=0, threadCountMethods=0, parallelOptimized=true
Configuring TestNG with: TestNGMapConfigurator
+---+
