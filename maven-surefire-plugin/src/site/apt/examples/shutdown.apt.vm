Shutdown of Forked JVM

* Embedded shutdown
  
  After the test-set has completed, the process executes
  <<<java.lang.System.exit(0)>>> which starts shutdown hooks. At this point
  the process may run next 30 seconds until all non daemon Threads die.
  After the period of time has elapsed, the process kills itself by
  <<<java.lang.Runtime.halt(0)>>>.

* Pinging forked JVM

  The master process sends NOOP command to a forked JVM every 10 seconds.
  Forked JVM is waiting for the command every 20 seconds.
  If the master process is killed (received SIGKILL signal) or shutdown 
  (pressed CTRL+C, received SIGTERM signal), forked JVM is killed after
  timing out waiting period.

* Shutdown of forked JVM by stopping the build

  After the master process of the build is shutdown by sending SIGTERM signal
  or pressing CTRL+C, the master process immediately sends SHUTDOWN command to
  every forked JVM. By default (configuration parameter <<<shutdown=testset>>>)
  forked JVM would not pick up a new test which means that the current
  test may still continue to run. The SIGTERM signal triggers Java shutdownhook
  which executes <<<java.lang.Process.destroy()>>> in the forked JVM (not always
  reliable depending on VM and OS).
  The parameter <<<shutdown>>> can be configured with other two values
  <<<exit>>> and <<<kill>>>. Using <<<exit>>> forked JVM executes
  <<<java.lang.System.exit(1)>>> after the master process has received SIGTERM.
  Using <<<kill>>> the JVM executes <<<java.lang.Runtime.halt(1)>>>, example:

+---+
<project>
  [...]
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>${project.groupId}</groupId>
        <artifactId>${project.artifactId}</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <configuration>
          <shutdown>kill</shutdown>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
  [...]
</project>

* Shutdown of forked JVM after certain timeout

  Using parammeter <<<forkedProcessTimeoutInSeconds>>> forked JVMs
  are killed separately after every individual process elapsed certain
  amount of time and the whole plugin fails with the error message:

  <<<There was a timeout or other error in the fork>>>
