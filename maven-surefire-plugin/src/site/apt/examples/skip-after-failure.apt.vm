Skipping Tests After First Failure

 To skip remaining tests after first failure or error has happened
 set configuration parameter <<<skipAfterFailureCount>>> to <<<1>>>.
 
 
Skipping Tests After the Nth Failure or Error

 To skip remaining tests after the Nth failure or error has happened
 set configuration parameter <<<skipAfterFailureCount>>> to N, where
 N is number greater than zero.
 
 
Prerequisite
 
 Use ${project.artifactId} 2.19 or higher, JUnit 4.0 or higher, or 
 TestNG 5.10 or higher.
 
 If version of TestNG is lower than 5.10 while the parameter 
 <<<skipAfterFailureCount>>> is set, the plugin fails with error:
 
 <<<[ERROR] Failed to execute goal ...: Parameter "skipAfterFailureCount"
 expects TestNG Version 5.10 or higher. java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError:
 org/testng/IInvokedMethodListener>>>

 
 
 If version of JUnit is lower than 4.0 while the parameter 
 <<<skipAfterFailureCount>>> is set, the plugin fails with error:
 
 <<<[ERROR] Failed to execute goal ...: Parameter "skipAfterFailureCount"
 expects JUnit Version 4.0 or higher. java.lang.NoSuchMethodError:
 org.junit.runner.notification.RunNotifier.pleaseStop()V>>>
 
 
Notices
 
 TestNG reports skipped methods however JUnit reports skipped classes.
 Preferably use JUnit 4.12 or higher version which fixed thread safety issues.
 
 
Limitations
 
 Although this feature works in forking modes as well, the functionality
 cannot be fully guaranteed (real first failure) in concurrent mode
 due to race conditions.
 The parameter <<<reuseForks>>> should be always set to <<<true>>> (which is
 default value), otherwise this feature won't work properly in most cases.

Other features

* Re-run and skip execution

  Since of 2.19.1 you can use parameters <<<skipAfterFailureCount>>> and <<<rerunFailingTestsCount>>> together.
  This is enabled by providers <<<surefire-junit4>>> and <<<surefire-junit47>>>. You can run again failed tests
  and skip the rest of the test-set if errors or failures reached <<<skipAfterFailureCount>>>.
  Notice that failed tests within re-run phase are not included in <<<skipAfterFailureCount>>>.
