Skipping Tests After First Failure

 To skip remaining tests after first failure or error has happened
 set configuration parameter <<<skipAfterFailureCount>>> to <<<1>>>.
 
 If version of TestNG is lover than 5.10 while the parameter 
 <<<skipAfterFailureCount>>> is set, the plugin fails with error:
 <<<[ERROR] org.apache.maven.surefire.util.SurefireReflectionException: 
 java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/testng/IInvokedMethodListener>>>
 
 
Skipping Tests After the Nth Failure or Error

 To skip remaining tests after the Nth failure or error has happened
 set configuration parameter <<<skipAfterFailureCount>>> to N, where
 N is number greater than zero.
 
 
Prerequisite
 
 Use ${project.artifactId} 2.19 or higher, JUnit 4.0 or higher, or 
 TestNG 5.10 or higher.
 
 
Notices
 
 TestNG reports skipped methods however JUnit reports skipped classes.
 Preferably use JUnit 4.12 or higher version which fixed thread safety issues.
 
 
Limitations
 
 Although this feature works in forking modes as well, the functionality
 cannot be fully guaranteed (real first failure) in concurrent mode
 due to race conditions.
