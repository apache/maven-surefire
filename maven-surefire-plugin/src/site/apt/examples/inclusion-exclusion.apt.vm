Inclusions and Exclusions of Tests

* Inclusions

  By default, the ${thisPlugin} Plugin will automatically include all test classes
  with the following wildcard patterns:

#{if}(${project.artifactId}=="maven-surefire-plugin")
   * <<<"**/Test*.java">>> - includes all of its subdirectories and all Java
   filenames that start with "Test".

   * <<<"**/*Test.java">>> - includes all of its subdirectories and all Java
   filenames that end with "Test".

   * <<<"**/*TestCase.java">>> - includes all of its subdirectories and all Java
   filenames that end with "TestCase".

#{else}
   * <<<"**/IT*.java">>> - includes all of its subdirectories and all Java
   filenames that start with "IT".

   * <<<"**/*IT.java">>> - includes all of its subdirectories and all Java
   filenames that end with "IT".

   * <<<"**/*ITCase.java">>> - includes all of its subdirectories and all Java
   filenames that end with "ITCase".

#{end}

   []

  If the test classes do not follow any of these naming conventions, then configure
  ${thisPlugin} Plugin and specify the tests you want to include.

+---+
<project>
  [...]
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>${project.groupId}</groupId>
        <artifactId>${project.artifactId}</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <configuration>
          <includes>
            <include>Sample.java</include>
          </includes>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
  [...]
</project>
+---+

* Exclusions

  There are certain times when some tests are causing the build to fail.
  Excluding them is one of the best workarounds to continue the build.
  Exclusions can be done by configuring the <<<excludes>>> property of the
  plugin.

#{if}(${project.artifactId}=="maven-surefire-plugin")
+---+
<project>
  [...]
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>${project.groupId}</groupId>
        <artifactId>${project.artifactId}</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <configuration>
          <excludes>
            <exclude>**/TestCircle.java</exclude>
            <exclude>**/TestSquare.java</exclude>
          </excludes>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
  [...]
</project>
+---+
#{else}
+---+
<project>
  [...]
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>${project.groupId}</groupId>
        <artifactId>${project.artifactId}</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <configuration>
          <excludes>
            <exclude>**/CircleIT.java</exclude>
            <exclude>**/SquareIT.java</exclude>
          </excludes>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
  [...]
</project>
+---+
#{end}

* Regular Expression Support

  An include/exclude pattern can be an ant-style path expression, but
  regular expressions are also supported through this syntax:

+---+
<project>
  [...]
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>${project.groupId}</groupId>
        <artifactId>${project.artifactId}</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <configuration>
          <includes>
            <include>%regex[.*[Cat|Dog].*Test.*]</include>
          </includes>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
  [...]
</project>
+---+

  Note the syntax <<<%regex[expr]>>>, where <<<expr>>> is the actual expression and the rest is just wrapping. Also
  note that regex matches are done over <<<*.class>>> files and not <<<*.java>>> files.

* Multiple Formats in One

  As of ${thisPlugin} Plugin 2.19, a complex syntax is supported in one parameter (JUnit 4, JUnit 4.7+, TestNG):

+---+
  [...]
          <include>%regex[.*[Cat|Dog].*], !%regex[pkg.*Slow.*.class], pkg/**/*Fast*.java, Basic????, !Unstable*</include>
  [...]
          <exclude>%regex[pkg.*Slow.*.class], Unstable*</exclude>
  [...]
+---+

  This syntax can be used in parameters: <<<test>>>, <<<includes>>>, <<<excludes>>>, <<<includesFile>>>, <<<excludesFile>>>.
  Exclamation mark (!) excludes tests. The syntax in parameter <<<excludes>>> and <<<excludesFile>>> should not use (!).
  The character (?) within non-regex pattern replaces one character in file name or path. The file extensions are not
  mandatory in non-regex patterns, and packages with slash can be used. The regex validates fully qualified class file.
  The regex supports '.class' file extension only. Note the regex comments, marked by (#) character, are unsupported.

* Fully qualified class name

  As of ${thisPlugin} Plugin 2.19.1, the syntax with fully qualified class names or packages can be used, e.g.:

+---+
  [...]
          <include>my.package.*, another.package.*</include>
  [...]
          <exclude>my.package.???ExcludedTest, another.package.*ExcludedTest</exclude>
  [...]
+---+

  The character (?) replaces single character and (*) represents zero or more characters.
  Multiple formats can be additionally combined.
  This syntax can be used in parameters: <<<test>>>, <<<includes>>>, <<<excludes>>>, <<<includesFile>>>, <<<excludesFile>>>.
