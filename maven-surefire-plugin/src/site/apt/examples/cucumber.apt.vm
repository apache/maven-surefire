Using Cucumber with JUnit

* Configuring Cucumber JUnit

  To get started with Cucumber, you need to add the required version of Cucumber JUnit to your project:

+---+
 <dependencies>
   [...]
     <dependency>
         <groupId>io.cucumber</groupId>
         <artifactId>cucumber-junit</artifactId>
         <version>${cucumber.version}</version>
         <scope>test</scope>
     </dependency>
   [...]
 </dependencies>
+---+

 Then create an empty class that uses the Cucumber JUnit runner.

+---+
package org.sample.cucumber;

import org.junit.runner.RunWith;

import cucumber.api.CucumberOptions;
import cucumber.api.junit.Cucumber;

@RunWith( Cucumber.class )
public class RunCucumberTest
{

}
+---+

  This will execute all scenarios in the package of the runner. By default glue code is assumed to be in the same
  package. The <<<@CucumberOptions>>> annotation can be used to provide additional configuration to the runner.

  Note that in this example the scenarios will be executed by the <<<maven-surefire-plugin>>>. To use the
  <<<maven-surefire-plugin>>> the class name should end with IT.

* Using JUnit Rules

  Cucumber supports JUnits <<<@ClassRule>>>, <<<@BeforeClass>>> and <<<@AfterClass>>> annotations. These will be
  invoked around the suite of features. Using these is not recommended as it limits the portability between different
  runners. Instead it is recommended to use Cucumbers `Before` and `After` hooks to setup scaffolding.

* Using other JUnit features

  The Cucumber runner acts like a suite of a JUnit tests. As such other JUnit features such as Categories, Custom JUnit
  Listeners and Reporters and re-running failed tests can all be expected to work.
