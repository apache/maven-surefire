Selecting Providers

* Unified Provider in Surefire 3.6.0+

  Since version 3.6.0, Surefire uses a single provider <<<surefire-junit-platform>>> to run all tests:

  * <<JUnit 5 tests>> are executed via the Jupiter Engine

  * <<JUnit 4 tests>> (4.12 or later) are executed via the Vintage Engine

  * <<TestNG tests>> (6.14.3 or later) are executed via the TestNG JUnit Platform Engine

  []

  This unified approach simplifies configuration and provides consistent behavior across all test frameworks.
  In most cases, no explicit provider configuration is needed - Surefire automatically detects and configures
  the appropriate engines based on your project's test dependencies.

* Legacy Provider Selection (Surefire before 3.6.0)

  In earlier versions of Surefire, there were multiple providers:
  <<<surefire-junit3>>>, <<<surefire-junit4>>>, <<<surefire-junit47>>>,
  <<<surefire-junit-platform>>> and <<<surefire-testng>>>.

  Surefire would automatically select which test-framework provider to use based on the version of
  TestNG/JUnit present in your project's classpath.

* Manual Engine Configuration

  While explicit provider configuration is rarely needed in Surefire 3.6.0+, you can still add
  specific JUnit Platform engines as plugin dependencies if needed:

+---+
<plugins>
  [...]
  <plugin>
    <groupId>${project.groupId}</groupId>
    <artifactId>${project.artifactId}</artifactId>
    <version>${project.version}</version>
    <dependencies>
      <dependency>
        <groupId>org.junit.jupiter</groupId>
        <artifactId>junit-jupiter-engine</artifactId>
        <version>5.9.1</version>
      </dependency>
    </dependencies>
  </plugin>
  [...]
</plugins>
+---+

  Please note that forcing an engine still requires that the test framework is properly set up on your project classpath.
