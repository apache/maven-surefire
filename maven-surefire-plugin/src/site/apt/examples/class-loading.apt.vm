Class Loading and Forking in Maven Surefire

 This page discusses class loading and forking under Maven Surefire which is a shared component used by both
 the Surefire and Failsafe Maven plugins, with an eye towards troubleshooting problems.

* Executive Summary

 If you're having problems, you'll probably want to tinker with these three settings: <<<forkCount>>>, <<<useSystemClassLoader>>>, and <<<useManifestOnlyJar>>>.

* What Problem does the Maven Surefire Project Solve?

 Initially, the problem seems simple enough. Just launch Java with a classpath, like this:
 
+---+
java -classpath foo.jar:bar.jar MyApp
+---+
 
 But there's a problem here: on some operating systems (Windows), there's a limit on how long you can make
 your command line, and therefore a limit on how long you can make your classpath. The limit is different
 on different versions of Windows; in some versions only a few hundred characters are allowed, in others
 a few thousand, but the limit can be pretty severe in either case.

* Update for Maven Surefire 2.8.2

 It turns out setting the <<<CLASSPATH>>> as an environment variable may remove most of the
 practical length limitations, as documented in {{{https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SUREFIRE-727}SUREFIRE-727}}.
 This means most of the length-related problems in this article may be outdated.

* Generic Solutions

 There are two "tricks" you can use to workaround this problem; both of them can cause other problems in some cases.

 1. <<Isolated Class Loader>>: One workaround is to use an isolated class loader.
 Instead of launching <MyApp> directly, we can launch some other application (a "booter")
 with a much shorter classpath. We can then create a new java.lang.ClassLoader
 (usually a <<<java.net.URLClassLoader>>>) with the desired classpath configured. The booter
 can then load up <MyApp> from the class loader; when <MyApp> refers to other classes,
 they will be automatically loaded from our isolated class loader.
 
 The problem with using an isolated class loader is that your classpath isn't
 <really> correct, and some applications can detect this and object. For example, the
 system property <<<java.class.path>>> won't include your jars; if your application notices
 this, it could cause a problem.
 
 There's another similar problem with using an isolated class loader: any class
 may call the static method <<<ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader()>>> and attempt to
 load classes out of that class loader, instead of using the default class loader.
 Classes often do this if they need to create class loaders of their own.
 Unfortunately, Java-based web application servers like Jetty, Tomcat, BEA
 WebLogic and IBM WebSphere are very likely to try to escape the confines of an
 isolated class loader.
 
 2. <<Manifest-Only JAR>>: Another workaround is to use a "manifest-only JAR." In
 this case, you create a temporary JAR that's almost completely empty, except for
 a <<<META-INF/MANIFEST.MF>>> file. Java manifests can contain attributes that the Java
 virtual machine will honor as directives. For example, you can have a <<<Class-Path>>> attribute,
 which specifies a list of other JARs to add to the classpath. So then you can run
 your code like this:
 
+---+
java -classpath booter.jar MyApp
+---+
  
 This is a bit more realistic, because in this case the system class loader, the
 thread context class loader and the default class loader are all the same; there's
 no possibility of "escaping" the class loader. But this is still a weird
 simulation of a "normal" classpath, and it's still possible for apps to notice
 this. Again, <<<java.class.path>>> may not be what you'd expect ("why does it contain
 only one jar?"). Additionally, it's possible to query the system class loader to
 get the list of jars back out of it; your application may be confused if it finds only
 our <<<booter.jar>>> there!

* Advantages/Disadvantages of each Solution

 If your application tries to interrogate its own class loader for a list of JARs, it may
 work better under an isolated class loader than it would with a manifest-only
 JAR.  However, if your application tries to escape its default class loader, it may not
 work under an isolated class loader at all.

 One advantage of using an isolated class loader is that it's the only way to use
 an isolated class loader without forking a separate process, running all of the
 tests in the same process as Maven itself.  But that itself can be pretty risky,
 especially if Maven is running embedded in your IDE!
 
 Finally, of course, you could just try to wire up a plain old Java classpath and hope
 it's short enough.  In the worst case your classpath might work
 on some machines and not others.  Windows boxes would behave differently from
 Linux boxes; users with short user names might have more success than users
 with long user names, etc.  For this reason, we chose not to make the basic
 classpath the default, though we do provide it as an option (mostly as a last
 resort).
 
* What does Maven Surefire do?

 Surefire provides a mechanism for using multiple strategies.  The main parameter that
 determines this is called <<<useSystemClassLoader>>>.  If <<<useSystemClassLoader>>> is
 <<<true>>>, then we use a manifest-only JAR; otherwise, we use an isolated
 class loader.  If you want to use a basic plain old Java classpath, you can set
 <<<useManifestOnlyJar=false>>> which only has an effect when <<<useSystemClassLoader=true>>>.

 The default value for <<<useSystemClassLoader>>> changed between Surefire 2.3 and
 Surefire 2.4, which was a pretty significant change.  In Surefire 2.3,
 <<<useSystemClassLoader>>> was <<<false>>> by default, and we used an isolated class loader.
 In Surefire 2.4, <<<useSystemClassLoader>>> is <<<true>>> by default.  No value works for
 everyone, but we think this default is an improvement; a bunch of
 hard-to-diagnose bugs get better when we <<<useSystemClassLoader=true>>>.

 Unfortunately, if <<<useSystemClassLoader>>> is set incorrectly for your application, you're going to
 have a problem on your hands that can be quite difficult to diagnose.  You might
 even be forced to read a long documentation page like this one.  ;-)

 If you're having problems loading classes, try setting <<<useSystemClassLoader=false>>>
 to see if that helps.  You can do that with the POM snippet below, or by setting
 <<<-Dsurefire.useSystemClassLoader=false>>>.  If that doesn't work, try setting
 <<<useSystemClassLoader>>> back to <<<true>>> and setting <<<useManifestOnlyJar>>> to <<<false>>>.

* Debugging Classpath Problems

 If you've read this far, you're probably fully equipped to diagnose problems that may occur during class loading.  Here's some general tips to try:

 * Run Maven with <<<--debug>>> (or equivalently, <<<-X>>>) to get more detailed output

 * Check your <<<forkCount>>>.  If <<<forkCount=0>>> (or <<<forkMode=never>>>, the deprecated version of that), it's impossible to use the system class loader or a plain old Java classpath; we have to use an isolated class loader.

 * If you're using the defaults, <<<useSystemClassLoader=true>>> and <<<useManifestOnlyJar=false>>>.  In that case, look at the generated manifest-only Surefire booter JAR.  Open it up (it's just a zip) and read its manifest.

 * Run Maven with <<<-Dmaven.${thisPlugin.toLowerCase()}.debug>>>, and attach to the running process with a debugger.
