      <question>What is the difference between maven-failsafe-plugin and maven-surefire-plugin?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          <a href="http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-surefire-plugin">maven-surefire-plugin</a>
          is designed for running unit tests and if any of the tests fail then it will fail the build immediately.

        <p>
          <a href="http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-failsafe-plugin">maven-failsafe-plugin</a>
          is designed for running integration tests, and decouples failing the build if there
          are test failures from actually running the tests.

    <faq id="vm-termination">
      <question>Surefire fails with the message "The forked VM terminated without saying properly goodbye"</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
        Surefire does not support tests or any referenced libraries calling System.exit() at any time. If
        they do so, they are incompatible with surefire and you should probably file an issue with the library/vendor.

        Alternatively the forked VM could also crash for a number of reasons, which can also make this issue happen.
        Look for the classical "hs_err*" files indicating VM crashes or examine the log output from running maven
        when the tests execute. Some "extraordinary" output from crashing processes may be dumped to the console/log.

        If this happens on a CI environment and only after some time runs there is a fair chance your test suite is
        leaking some kind of OS-level resource that makes things worse for every run. Regular os-level monitoring tools
        may give you some indication.

    <faq id="GWT">
      <question>How can I run GWT tests ?</question>
      <answer>
        There is a specific gwt-maven-plugin at codehaus, but if you want to run
        with surefire, you need the following settings:
        <p>
        Use the following configuration:<br/>
        <code>
        <![CDATA[ <useSystemClassLoader>true</useSystemClassLoader>]]><br/>
        <![CDATA[ <useManifestOnlyJar>false</useManifestOnlyJar>]]><br/>
        <![CDATA[ <forkMode>once</forkMode>]]><br/>
        </code>
        forkMode at least once, always if not enough
