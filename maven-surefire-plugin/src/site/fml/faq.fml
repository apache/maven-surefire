        <p>
          <a href="http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-surefire-plugin">maven-surefire-plugin</a>
          is designed for running unit tests and if any of the tests fail then it will fail the build immediately.

        <p>
          <a href="http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-failsafe-plugin">maven-failsafe-plugin</a>
          is designed for running integration tests, and decouples failing the build if there
          are test failures from actually running the tests.

    <faq id="vm-termination">
      <question>Surefire fails with the message "The forked VM terminated without properly saying goodbye".</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
        Surefire does not support tests or any referenced libraries calling <code>System.exit()</code> at any time. If
        they do so, they are incompatible with Surefire and you should probably file an issue with the library/vendor.

        Alternatively the forked VM could also have crashed for a number of reasons.
        Look for the classical "<code>hs_err*</code>" files indicating VM crashes or examine the Maven log output
        when the tests execute. Some "extraordinary" output from crashing processes may be dumped to the console/log.

        If this happens on a CI environment and only after it runs for some time, there is a fair chance your test suite is
        leaking some kind of OS-level resource that makes things worse at every run. Regular OS-level monitoring tools
        may give you some indication.

    <faq id="crashed-forks">
      <question>Crashed Surefire or Failsafe plugin must indicate crashed tests</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
        After a forked JVM has crashed the console of forked JVM prints <em>Crashed tests:</em> and lists the last test
        which has crashed. In the console log you can find the message
        <em>The forked VM terminated without properly saying goodbye</em>.

    <faq id="GWT">
      <question>How can I run GWT tests?</question>
      <answer>
        Mojohaus publishes a [gwt-maven-plugin](https://gwt-maven-plugin.github.io/gwt-maven-plugin/),
        but if you want to run with Surefire, you need the following settings:
        <p>
        Use the following configuration:<br/>
        <code>
        <![CDATA[ <useSystemClassLoader>true</useSystemClassLoader>]]><br/>
        <![CDATA[ <useManifestOnlyJar>false</useManifestOnlyJar>]]><br/>
        <![CDATA[ <forkCount>1</forkCount>]]><br/>
        </code>
        Try <code>reuseForks=true</code> and if it doesn't work, fall back to <code>reuseForks=false</code>

    </faq>
    <faq id="late-property-evaluation">
      <question>How do I use properties set by other plugins in <code>argLine</code>?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Maven does property replacement for <pre>${...}</pre> values in pom.xml before any
          plugin is run. So Surefire would never see the place-holders in its argLine property.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since the Version 2.17 using an alternate syntax for these properties, <pre>@{...}</pre> allows late
          replacement of properties when the plugin is executed, so properties that have been modified by other
          plugins will be picked up correctly.

    <faq id="failsafe-jar">
      <question>How maven-failsafe-plugin allows me to configure the jar file or classes to use?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
        By default maven-failsafe-plugin uses project artifact file in test classpath if packaging is set to "jar" in
        pom.xml. This can be modified and for instance set to main project classes if you use configuration parameter
        "classesDirectory". This would mean that you set value "${project.build.outputDirectory}" for the parameter
        "classesDirectory" in the configuration of plugin.

    </faq>
    <faq id="dumpfiles">
      <question>How to dump fatal errors and stack trace of plugin runtime if it fails?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
        By default <em>maven-failsafe-plugin</em> and <em>maven-surefire-plugin</em> dumps fatal errors in dump files
        and these are located in <em>target/failsafe-reports</em> and <em>target/surefire-reports</em>.
        Names of dump files are formatted as follows:
        <br/>
        <code>
        <![CDATA[ [date]-jvmRun[N].dump]]><br/>
        <![CDATA[ [date]-jvmRun[N].dumpstream]]><br/>
        <![CDATA[ [date].dumpstream]]><br/>
        <![CDATA[ [date].dump]]><br/>
        </code>

        Forked JVM process and plugin process communicate via std/out. If this channel is corrupted, for a whatever
        reason, the dump of the corrupted stream appears in <em>*.dumpstream</em>.
        </p>
      </answer>
    </faq>
    <faq id="corruptedstream">
      <question>Corrupted STDOUT by directly writing to native stream in forked JVM</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
        If your tests use native library which prints to STDOUT this warning message appears because the library
        corrupted the channel used by the plugin in order to transmit events with test status back to Maven process.
        It would be even worse if you override the Java stream by <em>System.setOut</em> because the stream is also
        supposed to be corrupted but the Maven will never see the tests finished and build may hang.
        <br/>
        This warning message appears if you use <em>FileDescriptor.out</em> or JVM prints GC summary.
        <br/>
        In that case the warning is printed
        <em>"Corrupted STDOUT by directly writing to native stream in forked JVM"</em>, and a dump file can be found
        in Reports directory.
        <br/>
        If debug level is enabled then messages of corrupted stream appear in the console.

    <faq id="kill-jvm">
      <question>The files cannot be deleted when Jenkins CI killed Maven process and the tests still continue running.</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Surefire and Failsafe plugin may kill forked Surefire JVM when the standard-input stream is closed.
          This works when you stop Maven process by CTRL+C but it is not guaranteed on all platforms and this mechanism
          will be removed after the version 3.0.0-M5 (setup of TCP sockets for interprocess communication).
          The Surefire and Failsafe 3.0.0-M4 disabled mechanism PINGing parent process and natively killing mechanism.
          In order to enable these mechanisms, see the documentation of the configuration parameter
          "enableProcessChecker" and enable these mechanisms. These mechanisms have some drawbacks regarding your
          OS systems and GC, therefore see the documentation for the parameter "enableProcessChecker".
