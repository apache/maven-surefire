Following this checklist to help us incorporate your 
contribution quickly and easily:

 - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SUREFIRE) filed 
       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not 
       require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without 
       pulling in other changes.
 - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.
 - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[SUREFIRE-XXX] - Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`,
       where you replace `SUREFIRE-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue. Best practice
       is to use the JIRA issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the 
       commit message.
 - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.
 - [ ] Run `mvn clean install` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will 
       be performed on your pull request automatically.
 - [ ] You have run the integration tests successfully (`mvn -Prun-its clean install`).

If your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an
[Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) if you are unsure
please ask on the developers list.
