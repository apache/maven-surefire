Showing Only Failed Tests

  By default, the Surefire Report Plugin shows the full test result (i.e., successes
  as well as failures) in the generated HTML. To be able to show the failures only, the
  property <<showSuccess>> should be set to <<false>>.

+----+
<project>
  [...]
  <reporting>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-surefire-report-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <configuration>
          <showSuccess>false</showSuccess>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </reporting>
  [...]
</project>
+----+

  Then execute <<<mvn site>>> for the report generation.

  It can also be set via command line with the standalone goal:

+----+
  mvn surefire-report:report -DshowSuccess=false
+----+
