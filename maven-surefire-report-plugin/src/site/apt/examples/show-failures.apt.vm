Showing Failure Tests

  By default, the Surefire Report Plugin shows all test result status (success
  and failures) in the generated HTML. To be able to show the failures only, the
  property <<showSuccess>> should be set to <<false>>.

+----+
<project>
  [...]
  <reporting>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-surefire-report-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <configuration>
          <showSuccess>false</showSuccess>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </reporting>
  [...]
</project>
+----+

  Then execute <<<mvn site>>> for the report generation.

  It can also be set via commandline with the standalone goal.

+----+
  mvn surefire-report:report -DshowSuccess=false
