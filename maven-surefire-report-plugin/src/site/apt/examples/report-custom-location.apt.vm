Configuring the Output Location as part of the Project Reports

  To change the location of the generated output report along with other
  project reports. The <<outputDirectory>> property of both
  <<<maven-site-plugin>>> and <<<maven-surefire-report-plugin>>> should be set to the
  new path. For more information, see the documentation of the
  {{{http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-site-plugin/}Maven Site Plugin}}.

  Please take note that if the <<outputDirectory>> of the Site Plugin
  is not configured, the output location of the Surefire report will still
  be the default.
