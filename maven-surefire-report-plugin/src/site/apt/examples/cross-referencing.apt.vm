Source Code Cross Reference

  There are times when we wish to know right away the line number of the
  source code that caused a test to the fail. The Surefire Report Plugin
  has the capability to cross reference the source code that made the test
  fail. In order to activate this feature, the <<<maven-jxr-plugin>>> should
  be declared in the <<<\<reporting\>>>> section of the POM along with the
  <<<maven-surefire-report-plugin>>>. For more details, please read the
  documentation of the
  {{{http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-jxr-plugin/}Maven JXR Plugin}}.

  After executing <<<mvn site>>> for site generation, you'll notice that from
  the <<Failure Details>> section of the report, a link is available to
  redirect you to the source code that caused the failure.

  In the figure below the code that caused the failure is
  <com.test.proj.AppTest:36>

  The link will redirect you to the source by clicking it.

* Disabling the Cross Reference Link

  To disable the link to the source code, the <<linkXRef>> property should
  be set to <<false>>. Alternatively one may simply omit the
  <<<maven-jxr-plugin>>> from the <<<\<reporting\>>>> section.
