Source Code Cross Reference

  There are times when we need to know right away the line number of the
  source code that caused the failure of the test. The Surefire Report Plugin
  has the capability to cross reference the source code that made the test
  failed. To be able to activate it, the <<<maven-jxr-plugin>>> should
  also be declared in the \<reporting\> section of the POM along with the
  <<<maven-surefire-report-plugin>>>. For more details, please read the
  documentation of the
  {{{http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-jxr-plugin/}Maven JXR Plugin}}.

  After executing <<<mvn site>>> for site generation, You'll notice that from
  the <<Failure Details>> section of the report, the link is available to
  redirect you to the source code that caused the failure.

  From the figure below the code that caused the failure is
  <com.test.proj.AppTest:36>

[../images/failure-details.PNG] Failure Details

  The link will redirect you to the source by clicking it.

* Disable the Cross Reference Link

  To disable the link to the source code, the <<linkXRef>> property should
  be set to <<false>>. Or another way is by not declaring the
  <<<maven-jxr-plugin>>> to the \<reporting\> section.
