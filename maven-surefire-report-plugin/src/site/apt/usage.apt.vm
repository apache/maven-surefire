Usage

* Generate the report as part of Project Reports

  To generate the Surefire report as part of the site generation, add the following in
  the \<reporting\> section of your POM:

+---+
<project>
  ...
  <reporting>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-surefire-report-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </reporting>
  ...
</project>
+---+

  When the <<<mvn site>>> is invoked, the report will be automatically
  included in the Project Reports menu as shown in the figure below.

* Generate the report as standalone

  The Surefire report can also generate the report using its standalone goal:

+---+
mvn surefire-report:report  
+---+

  A HTML report should be generated in <<<$\{basedir\}/target/site/surefire-report.html>>>.
